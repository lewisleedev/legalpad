# Legalpad

Simple web-based editor for certain ridiculous test that requires strict formatting and yet fails to deliver nice way to practice said formatting. Size and line counts are designed to be 1:1 compatible with the actual test.

By default, it automatically saves all changes to localStorage. You can also export to file (uses `.legalpad` extension by default but it can be any plaintext file with according html format) and load saved file.

Tested on Chromium/Firefox (works best with Firefox)

## Usage

You can use [Demo](https://dev.lewislee.net/legalpad) or you can host it for yourself.

Use bun to build

```
$ bun run build
```

Output is a static website you can host anywhere.
